Q1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?
A:
    Cuz functions can take multiple inputs and generate outputs without
    repeatedly typing the function we wanna use over and over again.

Q2. When does the code in a function execute: when the function is
    defined or when the function is called?
A:
    The code in a function only executes (runs) when it is called.

Q3. What statement creates a function?
A:
    It's a keyword called 'def'.

Q4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?
A:
    A function is an instruction set, while a fx call
    would execute said instruction set.

Q5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program?
    How many local scopes?
A:
    There is only one global scope per program, while local scopes are
    created upon function calls (not function definitions).

Q6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call
    returns?
A:
    All local variables are destroyed along with their respective scope(s)

Q7. What is a return value? Can a return value be part of an expression?
A:
    A return value is the value an expression evaluates to or results in.
    Yes, a return value can be used in an expression.

Q8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return
    value of a call to that function?
A:
    If it doesn't have a return statement, the default value would be
    'None'.

Q9. How can you force a variable in a function to refer to the
    global variable?
A:
    By inserting the 'global' keyword before the variable name.

Q10. What is the data type of None?
A:
    Its data type is 'NoneType'.

Q11. What does the import areallyourpetsnamederic statement do?
A:
    It allows code from the imported library/module to be referenced or
    used in the current program.

Q12. If you had a function named bacon() in a module named spam, how
     would you call it after importing spam?
A:
    Same as how a function would be called, one would call spam.bacon()

Q13. How can you prevent a program from crashing when it gets an error?
A:
    Including exception handling code, i.e try and except codeblocks.

Q14. What goes in the try clause? What goes in the except clause?
A:
    The code or expressions to be evaluated goes into the try clause,
    while any expressions which would result in possible errors go
    into the except clause.
