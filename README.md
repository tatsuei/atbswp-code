## Code for Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, by Al Sweigart
Personal repo of code corresponding to each chapter in Al Sweigart's Automate the Boring Stuff with Python book. All code has been modified to suit my own needs (I'm kinda lazy to re-run each program to do testing, so I added loops to do that for me.)

I've also added exception handling to (most of) the .py files throughout the chapters, and will be working on chapters 4 through 18 in the coming month(s).
